        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3> Chicken Pastina</h3>
        <p>The  chicken pastina is like a big, warm hug from an Italian grandma, 
            a comfort food that will, quite literally, change your mood.
             You can make this simple soup with a fortified broth if you have the time,
              or simply use off-the-shelf chicken broth for the 15-minute version.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups prepared chicken broth</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup stelline (star-shaped) pastina, or other pastina such as acini di pepe</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (1 1/2 ounces by weight)</li>
            <li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring broth to a simmer over medium-high heat. Taste; season with salt if needed. </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium, and stir in pastina. 
                Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 seconds less than the package directions, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off heat, and stir in black pepper, butter, and grated cheese.
             Stir constantly until butter disappears.</li>
             <li>Ladle pastina into hot bowls, top with more freshly ground black pepper and Parmigiano Reggiano, 
                and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1><em>Chef's Note</em></h1>
       <p> For a brothier, soupier version reduce the amount of pastina used. For a thicker, risotto-like  version,
         use more pastina. 
        If you have time, you can make a fortified broth as shown in the video. Simmer raw, bone-in chicken parts in a quart of store-bought
        chicken broth, plus 3 cups water, until chicken is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Add onions, carrots, celery, garlic cloves, 
        and a bay leaf for more flavor if desired. Remove chicken meat and reserve to use in the soup or other dishes. Strain broth and reserve until needed.</p>
